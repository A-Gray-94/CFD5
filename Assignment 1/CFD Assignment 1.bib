abstract = {When two-equation turbulence models are used, unrealistically large values of turbulence variables can appear due to the infringement of a realizability condition or to numerical error. To cure this in practical calculations, various limiters on the source terms are often employed. In the present work, a mathematically correct bound for eddy viscosity is obtained from the realizability condition itself. From this, realizability bounds for several terms of model equations are given. The effects of various bounds including the present one, are investigated on the predictions of fundamental flows including simple shear flows, supersonic compression ramp flow and supersonic base flow. It is shown that the limiter affects the prediction very significantly.

@article{Sampaio2014,
abstract = {The long recirculation bubble found in many industrial applications, mostly involving thin airfoils and thin plate wind deflectors, presents a challenging case for numerical models based on RANS methodology. A deeper understanding of this methodology and its limitations is gained through a series of numerical simulations of the incompressible flow around a thin flat plate of infinite wingspan at small incidences. In this numerically challenging flow, a thin recirculation zone with highly anisotropic turbulent structures is formed close to the leading edge after boundary layer separation. The importance of capturing anisotropy is thoroughly examined and quantitatively assessed in this paper, through a number of simulations employing both large eddy simulations (LES) and Reynolds average Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches. The former is validated against previous wind tunnel experiment. Since the experimental data does not provide all tensor components to fully assess RANS quality, and LES results can be considered as a reliable source, they are employed in the full characterization of turbulence and in the assessment of the several RANS models predictions presented in this paper. Quantitative results are shown for the errors in capturing the anisotropy part of the Reynolds stress tensor for several RANS models, including Spalart-Almaras, ??- ?? SST and transition k- ?? SST. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The flow field around a thin flat plate with a leading edge and an infinite wingspan at small incidences is a very complex flow due to the existence of laminar-to-turbulent transition, boundary layer separation, leading edge bubble and reattachment. Due to the flow complexity, its numerical prediction represents a considerable challenge. Therefore, the purpose of this study is the evaluation of turbulence models to predict this flow The solutions are obtained through the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for the two-dimensional steady state flow, using the SST $\kappa$−$\omega$ 2-equations model and the more complex Reynolds Stress Tensor Model (RSM). The SST $\kappa$−$\omega$ assumes isotropic modeling of the Reynolds tensor and fails to reproduce some important features of this particular flow. To account for the anisotropy, the Reynolds Stress Tensor Model (RSM) solves an additional set of transport equations for the Reynolds stress tensor, which provides better results for both first and second order statistics, but introduces an anomalous flow pattern in the reattachment region, demands an increase in computational cost and produces convergence difficulties. Due to these difficulties, this work also presents the solution obtained with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for the three-dimensional unsteady state flow, which provided considerable improvements in the results. Simulations were accomplished for 1 degree inclination angle of the flat plate with a Reynolds number of 2.13 × 105. The results are compared with available wind tunnel experimental data.},
