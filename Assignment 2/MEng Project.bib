abstract = {Formula 1 motorsport is a platform for maximum race car driving performance resulting from high-tech developments in the area of lightweight materials and aerodynamic design. In order to ensure the driver's safety in case of high-speed crashes, special impact structures are designed to absorb the race car's kinetic energy and limit the decelerations acting on the human body. These energy absorbing structures are made of laminated composite sandwich materials - like the whole monocoque chassis - and have to meet defined crash test requirements specified by the FIA. This study covers the crash behaviour of the nose cone as the F1 racing car front impact structure. Finite element models for dynamic simulations with the explicit solver LS-DYNA are developed with the emphasis on the composite material modelling. Numerical results are compared to crash test data in terms of deceleration levels, absorbed energy and crushing mechanisms. The validation led to satisfying results and the overall conclusion that dynamic simulations with LS-DYNA can be a helpful tool in the design phase of an F1 racing car front impact structure.},

abstract = {As composite materials grow both in range and volume of applications, the challenge to find the right fastening solution continues to grow. This paper explores some trusted fastening solutions within this fast growing market. The growth of composite materials The development of composites and plastics and their migration into applications habitually dominated by traditional materials such as wood and metal is a significant trend. Lighter, stronger, versatile and more mechanically stable, modern composite materials have found a home in almost every industrial sector. The issue of reducing weight or " light-weighting " has become central to innovation in the automotive sector, accentuated by high oil prices and regulatory pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Initially, lightweight composite materials such as carbon fibre were only used in very high end applications such as aerospace and super cars, as costs were very high and production processes slow. Increasingly, major car makers are introducing carbon fibre into their luxury models and many are examining ways to replace structural elements traditionally made in heavier metal with lightweight carbon fibre. As the volumes of carbon fibre production increases, the costs will fall and the number of applications in premium and standard car models will increase.},

abstract = {If the pundits are to be believed, something approaching 10{\%} of the world's population watches each Formula 1 race. Having said that, beneath its glamorous surface, few understand what exactly is involved and why it has evolved into "technological warfare". The strategy of Formula 1 will be discussed with a view to explain why the cars are so dependent on the use of advanced materials, in particular fibre reinforced composites. Any engineering structure, irrespective of its intended purpose, must be made of one or more materials. More often than not it is the choice and behaviour of those materials that determine its mechanical performance. The introduction of fibre reinforced composite chassis was one of the most significant developments in the history of Grand Prix motor racing. Technology advances gained from these advanced materials have produced cars that are lighter, faster and safer than ever before. A short introduction to the science of composite materials will be followed by a history of their use and development within the sport. Design manufacture and operation of composite structures will be reviewed. Reference will also be made to their energy absorbing properties that have contributed so significantly to the improved safety record of Formula 1 and the more specialist composite materials, such as carbon-carbon, used in brakes and clutches etc.},

abstract = {Thin-walled Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) energy-absorbing devices have been successfully used in premier racing leagues to drastically improve the crashworthiness of a vehicle. Since their introduction in Formula 1 (F1) in the second half of the 1990s, the Rear Impact (RIMP) attenuators have received particular attention and their utilisation has been documented in scholarly publications. The engineering development and certification of the RIMP of the Star Mazda Racecar is discussed in detail. Quasi-static and dynamic crush tests are performed on two RIMP designs, featuring very different stacking sequences, are experimentally investigated. While the overall behaviour is quite different, they both exhibit the ability to collapse in a stable, progressive fashion. Furthermore, although the overall shape of the load-stroke diagram, energy absorption characteristics and failure behaviour have shown very good agreement, the quasi-static test results tend to substantially overestimate the effective dynamic energy absorption characteristics. The final RIMP design is selected based on its higher energy absorption and friendlier manufacturing characteristics.

abstract = {During the last decades the attention given to vehicle crash energy management has been centred on composite structures. The use of fibre-reinforced plastic composite materials in automotive structures, in fact, may result in many potential economic and functional benefits due to their improved properties respect to metal ones, ranging from weight reduction to increased strength and durability features. Although significant experimental work on the collapse of fibre-reinforced composite shells has been carried out, studies on the theoretical modelling of the crushing process are quite limited since the complex and brittle fracture mechanisms of composite materials. Moreover most of the studies have been directed towards the axial crush analysis, because it represents more or less the most efficient design. A mathematical approach on the failure mechanisms, pertaining to the stable mode of collapse of thin-walled composite structures subjected to axial loading, is investigated. The analysis is conducted from an energetic point of view. The main energy contributions to the absorption (bending, petal formation, circumferential delamination, friction) are identifies and then the total internal energy is equated to the work done by the external load. The total crushing process can be seen as a succession of deformation states, each responsible for a partial absorption. The minimum configuration for each impact force in the specific state of deformation, function of several variables and dependent on geometric and material parameters is obtained. A comparison between theory and experiments concerning crushing loads and total displacements is presented, showing how the proposed analytical model is effective in predicting the energy absorption capability of axially collapsing composite shells.},

abstract = {Carbon fibre composites have shown to be able to perform extremely well in the case of a crash and are being used to manufacture dedicated energy-absorbing components, both in the motor sport world and in constructions of aerospace engineering. While in metallic structures the energy absorption is achieved by plastic deformation, in composite ones it relies on the material diffuse fracture. The design of composite parts should provide stable, regular and controlled dissipation of kinetic energy in order to keep the deceleration level as least as possible. That is possible only after detailed analytical, experimental and numerical analysis of the structural crashworthiness.This paper is presenting the steps to follow in order to design specific lightweight impact attenuators. Only after having characterised the composite material to use, it is possible to model and realise simple CFRP tubular structures through mathematical formulation and explicit FE code LS-DYNA. Also, experimental dynamic tests are performed by use of a drop weight test machine.Achieving a good agreement of the results in previously mentioned analyses, follows to the design of impact attenuator with a more complex geometry, as a composite nose cone of the Formula SAE racing car. In particular, the quasi-static test is performed and reported together with numerical simulation of dynamic stroke. In order to initialize the collapse in a stable way, the design of the composite impact attenuator has been completed with a trigger which is consisted of a very simple smoothing (progressive reduction) of the wall thickness. Initial requirements were set in accordance with the 2008 Formula SAE rules and they were satisfied with the final configuration both in experimental and numerical crash analysis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aluminium sandwich construction has been recognized as a promising concept for structural purposes in lightweight transportation systems. The aim of the present study is to investigate, through experiment as well as numerical approaches, the energy absorbing capabilities of a thinwalled crashbox, made of sandwich material, for a racing car. The basic considered structures are panels composed of two aluminium alloy sheets and an aluminium hexagonal cells honeycomb core. Several crash tests were performed, in the conditions related to a frontal impact at the velocity of 12 m/s, in order to acquire information on the dynamic behaviour of the mentioned structure; during these tests the loaddeformation diagram, the deceleration and the energy absorbed by the structure were measured. A finite element model is then developed using the nonlinear, explicit dynamic code LSDYNA. In order to characterize the material and to set up the numerical model, a series of strength tests were carried out on aluminium honeycombcored sandwich panel specimens. By means of these preliminary tests some necessary material parameters were determined. The simulation results accurately predicted the average deceleration, the specific absorbed energy and the total deformation of the specimen, but appeared to slightly overestimate the initial peak load obtained in the crash tests. Therefore the performed investigation can help to build confidence in the future possibility of using nonlinear dynamic finite element code LSDYNA for the design of sandwich primary structures subjected to crash loading, especially after a further tuning up of the models and material characteristics.},

The main aim of the present study is to validate the recent micro-mechanical model for internal damage occurring in composites. The relationship between the composite size and strength was experimentally evaluated, and the composite strength decreased as the composite size increased. Microscopic damage observation showed the existence of localized damage (i.e. a cluster of fiber breakage). Based on a 3D shear-lag model considering the matrix-yielding properties, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation of the damage process using the measured fiber strength distribution for several gage lengths. The simulation shows that Weibull of Weibull (WOW) statistics considering the fiber-to-fiber strength variation is appropriate for predicting the present composite failure, rather than a traditional Weibull model. The simulated result showed a good agreement with the upper bounds of the experimental data. It was found that the size-dependent strength of composite could be predicted based on the microscopic models.},

abstract = {Abstract The design of composite materials seems more challenging compared with that of their metallic counterparts because of their microstructural heterogeneity and sophisticated behavior. The ever-wider use of composite materials for structural applications in the automotive industry makes it necessary to predict their behavior under varying load conditions. This chapter is focused on the experimental and numerical crashworthiness design of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic structures under quasi-static and dynamic axial loading. The material used for this research is a prepreg obtained from high-strength carbon fibers embedded in an epoxy resin. Initially, simple geometries were taken into account to evaluate the influence of several geometric parameters and loading conditions on the final deformation. Afterward, a more complex geometry, equal to that adopted for the frontal impact attenuator of a Formula {\{}SAE{\}} car, was investigated. For each analysis, the numerical results were compared with those obtained from real axial crushing tests. The study indicates that the deformation behavior of the laminate calculated by using numerical models was in good agreement with experimental results; despite the simplification adopted, the finite element models were able to capture the main crushing parameters with maximum relative errors of 10{\%}.},

abstract = {As more and more new functional requirements are placed, some novel development of sectional configurations of the structural members has been increasingly introduced. This paper presents the optimal design for tapered tubes of three different configurations, namely hollow single, foam-filled single and collinear double tubes. To represent complex crashworthiness objective functions, a surrogate model method, more specifically, response surface method (RSM), was adopted in this study. The design of experiments (DoEs) of the factorial design and Latin Hypercube Sampling techniques is employed to construct the response surface models of specific energy absorption (SEA) and the maximum impact load (MaxL), respectively. In this paper, the linearly weighted average, geometrical average and particle swarm optimization methods are utilized in the multiobjective optimization for these three different tapered tube cases, respectively. A comparison is made among the different tapered profiles with the different optimization algorithms, and the crashworthiness merits of foam-filled tapered tubes are identified. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Electric vehicle energy consumption may be minimized redesigning specific car parts in order to not compromise crashworthiness aspects. Although more challenging compared with metallic counterparts because of their microstructural heterogeneity and behavioral sophistication, composite materials seem to be the best solution due to high specific strength and energy absorption. Differently from traditional shape, electric vehicle may be equipped with frontal impact attenuator whose geometry is very similar to the square frusta adopted for racing cars. The paper aims at developing an analytical procedure in order to capture the energy absorption capability of square impact attenuators with a square frusta geometry. Both metallic and composite materials are analysed in order to save the body weight. An energetic approach is addressed taking into account the energy contributions responsible for the absorption during crushing. Comparing the metallic and the composite model introduced, the best configuration of an electric vehicle specific frontal impact attenuator able to absorb a fixed impact energy is obtained. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {n this paper, the impact energy absorption behavior of carbon and glass fiber composite materials will be discussed. In particular, the crush behavior of cylindrical and conical structures will be evaluated based on micromechanical failure modes. Studies show that stiffness and strength of the constituent materials alone cannot be used to design impact structures. Experimental results also show that by controlling the mode of micromechanical damage, crush efficiency can be maximized. Moreover, crushed structures which form many microcracks in the fiber and resin have increased energy absorption. Based on these results, some generic design guidelines for improving the energy absorption capacity of composite structures will be shown.},

abstract = {Hybridisation of multiple materials is emerging as a key strategy to achieve high performance lightweight structures while keeping the cost low. Fundamental to creating strong and cost-effective hybrid composites is the ability to efficiently join dissimilar materials. Herein we present a novel co-curing ply-overlap joint technique for integrating dissimilar composite materials. Experimental studies are conducted to identify the dominant failure mechanisms and the effect of design parameters, such as the spatial distances between ply terminations and overlap length, on the strength of hybrid composite ply-overlap joints. To enable optimisation of ply-overlap joints, analytical and computational models are developed and validated against the experimental data. The results demonstrate that ply-overlap joints are capable of approaching the un-notched strength of the glass composite material. The validated predictive tools enable design optimisation of hybrid composite structures.},

@article{Savage2004,
abstract = {The survivability of a Formula driver in an accident is achieved by a combination of the crash resistance of the car and its ability to absorb energy. This has been achieved by providing a survival cell (the chassis), which is extremely resistant to damage, around which energy absorbing devices are placed at strategic points on the vehicle. Since the late 1980s the controlling body of Formula 1, FIA, has introduced a series of regulations to ensure that the cars conform to stringent safety requirements and build quality. Each vehicle must satisfy a list of requirements, in the form of officially witnessed tests, before it is allowed to race. There are two groups of tests that must be passed. The first is a series of static loads applied to the chassis, which guarantees the strength and integrity of the survival cell. The second series defines the position, and effectiveness of the energy absorbing structures. In order to keep the weight of the car to a minimum, some of the energy absorbing devices are also required to perform a structural function in addition to their ability to absorb energy by controlled disintegration. The Rear Impact Structure (RIMP), for example, sits on the differential cover at the rear of the gearbox. The function of this device is to react the downforce generated by the rear wing assembly as well as to provide protection in the event of a crash. Engineering structures are generally designed such that they do not fail. Producing a component, which is specifically intended to fail in a catastrophic, but controlled manner, presents a unique set of problems to the designer. When the same piece is also required to perform as a load-bearing member, the engineering problems are far more acute. The design process from materials selection to a finished component is discussed for an F1 RIMP. Particular reference is made to the design and analysis process and how it deals with the conflicting aspects of controlled fracture and load bearing durability. The analysis and testing process required to prove the piece fit for purpose and homologated for competition are also covered. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The main features of progressive folding and progressive crushing in tubes subjected to axial compression are summarised, with particular reference to the geometry of the folded or crushed region and the force-displacement response. A detailed account is given of the two main modes of progressive crushing, splaying and fragmentation, which occur in tubes made from fibre-reinforced composite materials. The main theme of this paper is that the crush geometry and the force-displacement response are interrelated and that the wide range of material and testing variables which affect the crushing behaviour can be accounted for on this basis. By way of example, a detailed description is given of the effect of fibre arrangement on progressive crushing in carbon fibre-epoxy unidirectional laminated tubes, woven glass cloth-epoxy tubes, filament-wound angle-ply glass fibre-polyester tubes and inplane random chopped glass fibre-polyester tubes. Transitions between splaying and fragmentation modes are identified and related to the force-displacement response. Similar transitions have been reported with other variables, such as fibre and matrix properties, dimensions and shape of tubes, speed and temperature effects, and trigger geometries.

@phdthesis{Uusitalo2013,
abstract = {The need for lighter vehicles is becoming more and more important for the heavy-duty industry. This can be achieved by using composite materials. One of the most promising materials is carbon fibre reinforced plastics, a composite material with carbon fibres bonded together by a polymer. Carbon fibre reinforced plastics are in many ways different from conventional materials, such as steel that is commonly used in the structural parts today. This project has investigated issues with using carbon fibre reinforced plastics, with a focus on fatigue and how to design in composite materials. In the early phases of the project, a literature review was done, where delamination, galvanic corrosion, fatigue and joining were seen as the most critical problems. This was followed by further investigation of fatigue. Fatigue is weakening of the material due to cyclic loading and is difficult to predict and to validate because of the inhomogeneous structure of composite materials, and because failure often is sudden and without prior notice. If fatigue is critical is very much dependent on the type of loading and the design of the structure. It is therefore important to have fatigue in mind when designing in composite materials, to minimise its impact and the risk it occur. Many factors affect the material behaviour and that have to be considered when designing in composite materials, such as the material properties and the material design, e.g. the lay-up of the fibres, the manufacturing process, and the design of the structure. The behaviour can also be affected by environmental conditions and the type of load applied to the composite. Due to all those parameters and the complexity of composites it is difficult to give clear directions of how to design in composite materials. There are however general guidelines that have to be followed for most composites, for example the fibre orientation is strongly affecting the strength of the composite. The result of this thesis is guidelines for designing in composite materials, the guidelines states important parameters to have in mind when designing.},

Therefore, the industry requires vigilance in maintaining standards to keep pace with technology developments, enabling safe deployment and long term operation. Certification of wind farms, wind turbines and their components is state-of-the-art and a must in most places around the world. It helps to attract investors, satisfy insurers and to bring offshore project development on the next level. Furthermore assessment to harmonised regulations is an active support of export and eases market entries. Accompanied by certification of training systems or maintenance services it provides comprehensive backup for the whole project. Therefore it is important to know the certification processes and guidelines as well as the keystones of their development for all parties involved in a project lifecycle.This paper puts focus on the latest guideline developments for GL 2012 and describes the outcome and latest innovations of GL Renewables Certification (GL RC) and its wind and marine energy committee for certification of offshore wind turbines and projects. Issues like load assumptions, floating wind turbines and risk based approval are some of them.
