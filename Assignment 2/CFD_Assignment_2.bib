@techreport{Chu1996,
abstract = {An experimental wind tunnel test of a 65 deg delta wing model with interchangeable leading edges was conducted in the Langley National Transonic Facility (NTF). The objective was to investigate the effects of Reynolds and Mach numbers on slender-wing leading-edge vortex flows with four values of wing leading-edge bluntness. Experimentally obtained pressure data are presented without analysis in tabulated and graphical formats across a Reynolds number range of 6 x 10(exp 6) to 84 x 10(exp 6) at a Mach number of 0.85 and across a Mach number range of 0.4 to 0.9 at Reynolds numbers of 6 x 10(exp 6) and 60 x 10(exp 6). Normal-force and pitching-moment coefficient plots for these Reynolds number and Mach number ranges are also presented.},

@article{Cummings2003,
abstract = {Aircraft aerodynamics have been predicted using computational fluid dynamics for a number of years. While viscous flow computations for cruise conditions have become commonplace, the non-linear effects that take place at high angles of attack are much more difficult to predict. A variety of difficulties arise when performing these computations, including challenges in properly modeling turbulence and transition for vortical and massively separated flows, the need to use appropriate numerical algorithms if flow asymmetry is possible, and the difficulties in creating grids that allow for accurate simulation of the flowfield. These issues are addressed and recommendations are made for further improvements in high angle of attack flow prediction. Current predictive capabilities for high angle of attack flows are reviewed, and solutions based on hybrid turbulence models are presented. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
