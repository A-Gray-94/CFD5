abstract = {Here, we report on a new concept for formation of mixed matrix reverse osmosis membranes by interfacial polymerization of nanocomposite thin films in situ on porous polysulfone supports. Nanocomposite films created for this study comprise NaA zeolite nanoparticles dispersed within 50-200 nm thick polyamide films. Hand-cast pure polyamide membranes exhibit surface morphologies characteristic of commercial polyamide RO membranes, whereas nanocomposite membranes have measurably smoother and more hydrophilic, negatively charged surfaces. At the highest nanoparticle loadings tested, hand-cast nanocomposite film morphology is visibly different and pure water permeability is nearly double that of hand-cast polyamide membranes with equivalent solute rejections. Comparison of membranes formed using pore-filled and pore-opened zeolites suggest nanoparticle pores play an active role in water permeation and solute rejection. The best performing nanocomposite membranes exhibit permeability and rejection characteristics comparable to commercial RO membranes. As a concept, thin film nanocomposite membrane technology may offer new degrees of freedom in tailoring RO membrane separation performance and material properties. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Graphene can be considered as an idealmembrane since its thickness is only one carbon diameter. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate water transport through a porous graphene membrane and com- pare the results with water transport through thin (less than 10 nm in thickness/ length) carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes. For smaller diameter pores, where a single-file water structure is obtained, CNT membranes provide higher water flux compared to graphene membranes. For larger diameter pores, where the water structure is not single-file, graphene membranes provide higher water flux compared to CNT membranes. Furthermore, in thin CNT membranes, the water flux did not vary significantly with the thickness of the membrane.We explain the results through a detailed analysis considering pressure distribution, velocity profiles, and potential of mean force. This work opens up opportunities for graphene-based membranes in molecular sieving, water filtration, fuel cells, and so forth.},

abstract = {Providing clean and affordable water to meet human needs is a grand challenge of the 21st century. Worldwide, water supply struggles to keep up with the fast growing demand, which is exacerbated by population growth, global climate change, and water quality deterioration. The need for technological innovation to enable integrated water management cannot be overstated. Nanotechnology holds great potential in advancing water and wastewater treatment to improve treatment efficiency as well as to augment water supply through safe use of unconventional water sources. Here we review recent development in nanotechnology for water and wastewater treatment. The discussion covers candidate nanomaterials, properties and mechanisms that enable the applications, advantages and limitations as compared to existing processes, and barriers and research needs for commercialization. By tracing these technological advances to the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, the present review outlines the opportunities and limitations to further capitalize on these unique properties for sustainable water management. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Cohen-Tanugi2012,
abstract = {We show that nanometer-scale pores in single-layer freestanding graphene can effectively filter NaCl salt from water. Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane's ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.},

@article{Hummer2001,
abstract = {Confinement of matter on the nanometre scale can induce phase transitions not seen in bulk systems. In the case of water, so-called drying transitions occur on this scale as a result of strong hydrogen-bonding between water molecules, which can cause the liquid to recede from nonpolar surfaces to form a vapour layer separating the bulk phase from the surface. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous filling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a one-dimensionally ordered chain of water molecules. Although the molecules forming the chain are in chemical and thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath, we observe pulse-like transmission of water through the nanotube. These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that density fluctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis. We also find that a minute reduction in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and filled states on a nanosecond timescale. These observations suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their rigid nonpolar structures, might be exploited as unique molecular channels for water and protons, with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by changes in the local channel polarity and solvent conditions.},

Theoretical studies have indicated that the performance of such membranes should be superior to state-of-the-art polymer-based filtration membranes, and experimental studies have recently begun to explore their potential. Here, we show that single-layer porous graphene can be used as a desalination membrane. Nanometre-sized pores are created in a graphene monolayer using an oxygen plasma etching process, which allows the size of the pores to be tuned. The resulting membranes exhibit a salt rejection rate of nearly 100{\%} and rapid water transport. In particular, water fluxes of up to 10(6) g m(-2) s(-1) at 40 °C were measured using pressure difference as a driving force, while water fluxes measured using osmotic pressure as a driving force did not exceed 70 g m(-2) s(-1) atm(-1).},

abstract = {A new apparatus (UVASUN 5000) is presented with high radiation energy between 320-460 nm. The measurable energy below 320 nm was shown to be many orders of magnitude too low to produce erythema. The radiator is a specially developed source for high UV-A intensity, housing a quartz bulb with a mixture of argon, mercury and metal-halides. At a skin-target distance of 0.2 m the size of the irradiated area is 0.35 X 0.35 m, and the measured mean UV-A intensity is about 1400 W . m-2 (140 mW . cm-2). The UV-A energy in the range of 320-400 nm is about 84{\%} of the total radiation energy. Effects of very high doses of UV-A on human skin were studied. Following single UV-A applications the minimal tanning dose UV-A (MTD) and the immediate pigment darkening (IPD) dose of UV-A were established. The calculated IPD threshold time was 1.8 min at 0.2 m. Repeated exposure to this UV-A delivering system yields long lasting dark brown skin pigmentation without any clinical or histological signs of "sunburn" (UV-B) damage, epidermal hyperplasia or thickening of the stratum corneum. The instrument was also successfully used for photo-patch testing and reproduction of skin lesions of polymorphous light eruption.

abstract = {The importance as well as impact of application of carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes in the area of water technology development is tremendous. A substantial amount of work have been carried out with impregnation of CNTs (simply as one of the reinforcements for incorporation of better properties like antibiofouling and/or better strength, etc.) in polymer host matrix. However, the volume of work enabling CNTs as flow channels (in a membranous structure) is not significant and that is where the potential benefits of CNTs lie. Moreover, from impressive works carried out in this direction, it is quite obvious that still significant challenges have to be addressed to align the CNTs, to reinforce it in a suitable host matrix without disturbing the alignment and inhibiting the agglomeration (adoption of suitable nanocomposite fabrication route), to open the tips preferentially and to scale up favorably. It is believed that the innovative attributes put forth by CNTs and the application areas identified with CNTs are getting matured, while the area of development of CNT (based) membranes is far from being matured and it still needs to be looked into in the light of involvement of materials as well as process challenges.},

@phdthesis{Chan2015,
abstract = {Cost - effective purification and desalination of water is a global challenge. Reverse osmosis (RO), the current method of choice, requires high pressure drops across the membranes in order to achieve acceptably high flow rates. Conventional polymer membrane s are limited in their performance by a trade - off between water permeability and water/salt selectivity. Biofilm fouling is another critical problem in RO applications. Recent simulations and experiments suggest that properly functionalized carbon nanotube s (CNTs) can be used to construct RO membranes that have high permeation flux as well as complete ion rejection, and that are resistant to biofilm formation. The objective of this research was to combine zwitterion - functionalized carbon nanotubes with trad itional thin film polyamide (PA) to fabricate a novel desalination membrane which has both high permeability as well as selectivity. Zwitterion functional groups in CNTs act as molecular gatekeepers at the entrance of the nanotubes to enhance blockage for salt ions. Functionalized CNTs were oriented on a membrane support by high vacuum filtration. These oriented CNTs were sealed by a polyamide film via interfacial polymerization. Cross - sectional image of the nanocomposite membrane taken by scanning electro n microscopy (SEM) showed semi - aligned zwitterion - CNTs on top of a porous support covered by a thin PA film with an overall thickness of approximately 250 nm. When the concentration of zwitterion - CNTs in the membrane increased, the nanocomposite membranes experienced significant improvement in permeation flux while the ion rejection increases slightly or remains unchanged . This indicated that the increased water flux is not due to an increase in nonspecific pores in the membrane, but rather due to an additi onal transport mechanism resulting from the presence of the functionalized CNTs. Significant increase of flux was also observed in separating cations other than sodium. The separation of the PA skin layer dominated the ion rejection mechanism by size exclu sion even when the carbon nanotubes were introduced into the polyamide coating. The zwitterion functional groups exposed at the membrane surface also interacted with the feed water to form a strong hydration layer, which results in improved surface biofoul ing resistance. The adsorption rate of protein foulants on the nanocomposite membrane surface was significantly reduced compared to the control membrane without CNTs, and the adsorbed fouling layer could be easily removed by flushing with water. After wash ing, the nanocomposite membrane recovered 100{\%} of the decreased water flux whereas the control membrane only recovered 10{\%} of the decreased flux resulting in a permanent loss of 30{\%} in water permeation. We have therefore demonstrated that advanced material s like CNTs can be synthesized with desired functional groups, and can be embedded into traditional RO membranes to simultaneously resolve the challenge of low flux and surface fouling in the current desalination process.},

abstract = {A novel TiO2/MoS2 composite photocatalyst with high visible-light activity was prepared via a one-step hydrothermal process using titaniumtetrachloride (TiCl4) as a titanium resource and bulk MoS2 as a direct photosensitizer. The photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) in aqueous suspension was employed to evaluate the visible light activity of the as-prepared composite photocatalyst with a xenon lamp as simulated solar irradiation. The chemical composition, optical properties, morphology, structure, and thermal stability of the composite photocatalysts were characterized using XPS, UV-vis, FS, SEM, XRD, and TGA. The as-prepared photocatalysts exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity from the experiment on the degradation of methyl orange, compared to the performance of commercial titania (Degussa P25). The degradation rate of MO can reach over 90{\%} in 10min when the molar ratio of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) to titanium dioxide (TiO2) is 0.8:50 and the mass concentration of the TiO2/MoS2 composite photocatalyst is 400mg/L. In this research, a new fabrication mode of TiO2/MoS2/TiO2 was applied for fabricating new hybridized structures of nano-TiO2/MoS2 by using bulk MoS2 as a direct photosensitizer, which changed the energy levels of the conduction band of MoS2 and strongly promoted interparticle electron transfer. In addition, this hybridization structure was believed to have a synergistic effect in the process of photocatalytic oxidation owing to increasing the degree of charge carrier separation, which effectively reduced recombination and improved the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/MoS2 composite photocatalyst.},
